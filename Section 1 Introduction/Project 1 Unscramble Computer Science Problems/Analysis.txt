Task0.py

- Retrieval of first record of texts and last record of calls takes constant time i.e. O(1) as we are accessing python array


Task1.py

- To count unique telephone numbers from records we have to go through each of them
- lets says there are n records therefore time complexity is O(n)


Task2.py

- We first go through each record that has time complexity is O(n)
- Then we find key with max value that again has time complexity is O(n)
- So in total its is O(n) + O(n) that simplifies to O(n)


Task3.py

- For part A, since we had to go thorugh every record one by one time complexity is O(n) 
- and the sorting using .sort method has time complexity O(n logn)
- So we end up simplifying them into O(n log n).
- For part B, since we had to go thorugh every record one by one time complexity is O(n).
- For whole .py file i.e. Part A and B combined time complexity isO(n) 


Task4.py

- since we had to go through every record one by one and then use sort method in python so simplified time complexity is O(n logn).
